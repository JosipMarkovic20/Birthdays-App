# Birthdays-App

Installation is simple, just run the project in Xcode. \n
Project was initialized with basic boilerplate code to save time./n
In this project, I have used single-stream Rx MVVM architecture with minimal dependencies possible./n
The layout is written programmatically and constrained using SnapKit./n
Network requests are done with Apollo and GraphQL./n
For navigation, I have used the coordinator pattern, and for getting data inside the ViewModel I have used the repository pattern.n/
If given more time I would spend it on unit testing and generalizing InitialsView, for this simple app this approach works just fine.n/
