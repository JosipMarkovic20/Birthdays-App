# Birthdays-App

Installation is simple, just run the project in Xcode. 
Project was initialized with basic boilerplate code to save time. 
In this project, I have used single-stream Rx MVVM architecture with minimal dependencies possible. 
The layout is written programmatically and constrained using SnapKit. 
Network requests are done with Apollo and GraphQL. 
For navigation, I have used the coordinator pattern, and for getting data inside the ViewModel I have used the repository pattern. 
If given more time I would spend it on unit testing and generalizing InitialsView, for this simple app this approach works just fine.
